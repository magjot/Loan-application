# Loan-application

Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not using machine learning. By leveraging a dataset containing applicant information (such as income, credit history, loan amount, etc.), we build a model that helps financial institutions make more accurate loan approval decisions.

The objective of this project is to create a classification model that can predict whether an applicant qualifies for a loan. It covers the complete process: data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment.
